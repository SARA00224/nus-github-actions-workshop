## What is this?

This repo is a hands-on companion to a GitHub Actions workshop. The game runs entirely in the browser: Canvas rendering, game logic, localStorage high scores. There's also a Python/Flask backend that provides a score API, but the game works fine without it (open `app/static/index.html` in a browser and it just works).

The `lessons/` folder walks through setting up GitHub Actions for this project, step by step.

## Running locally

### Static (no backend)

Open `app/static/index.html` in your browser. Done.

### With the Flask backend

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m app.main
```

Then open http://localhost:5000.

### With Docker

```bash
docker build -t octocat-game .
docker run -p 5000:5000 octocat-game
```

## Running tests

Frontend (needs Node.js 18+):

```bash
node --test tests/test_logic.js
```

Backend (needs Python 3.10+):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pytest
```

## Workshop lessons

| Lesson | What it covers |
|--------|---------------|
| [01: Frontend tests](lessons/01-frontend-tests/) | Run JavaScript tests on every push and PR |
| [02: Deploy to GitHub Pages](lessons/02-github-pages/) | Deploy the static game to Pages if tests pass |
| [03: Backend tests](lessons/03-backend-tests/) | Add Python tests alongside the JS tests |
| [04: Docker build & push](lessons/04-docker-build/) | Build and push to GHCR if all tests pass |
| [05: Full pipeline](lessons/05-full-pipeline/) | Everything in one file, with trade-off discussion |

Each lesson has a README and a workflow YAML you copy into `.github/workflows/`.
